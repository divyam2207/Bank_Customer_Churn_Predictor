# Bank_Customer_Churn_Predictor
Applied basic Deep Learning using tensorflow on a demo bank dataset of its customer to predict whether the customer will churn or not.

- Achieved an accuracy of over 85% by tuning the hyperparameters.
- Applied two hidden layers in the model.
- Used stochaistic gradient descent for batch wise operations to achieve better accuracy.
- Finnaly used confusion matrix to get the details about the number of correct predictions in test and trained dataset.
